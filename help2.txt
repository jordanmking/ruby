alrighty back again with the same problem but more specifications.
i've been trying for 2 days to install mint to an internal harddrive via 
my lenovo via usb to sata and i have had alot of difficulties.
i can get the hard drive to show up in disks as /dev/sdb but it says no media
and under size __.it won't show up however in gparted.
i'm wondering if there is something i have to do to prepare the media to 
show up in gparted as /dev/sdb and then i wish to format drive and all that
..
whenever i try to format the drive from windows disk part it doesnt
let me create partition primary it says device is not ready
i googled it and came up with a few sites non related 
something telling me to delete something in computer management
under usb and i did and still nothing
i am wondering do i have a corrupt hard drive
or is it just not able to be read because it needs to be prepped
or is my controller/connector not communicating with linux
because it shows up in disks so i dont think thats the problem
ive been narrowing it down but i ordered a western digital external 2tb
to use as my portable collection of distros
so in two days ill probably just drill press these two wonky jank hard drives
unless some unknown master can solve my problem.
if you need any more specs let me know. 
thx

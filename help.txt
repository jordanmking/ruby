okay i've got a problem
ive been trying to install ubuntu to an internal drive via USB to SATA
externally through the usb port on my notebook
my notebook doesnt recognize the hard drive at all
so i loaded into the bios settings of my lenovo yoga
connected the hard drive via usb
changed to enable legacy boot
selected boot priority
1.legacy (internal hard drive connected via usb)
2.usb boot stick
3.normal shit
so i load into the hard drive then the bootable usb kicks on
and i get this
failed to load ldlinux.c32
boot failed: please change disks and press a key to continue
so when i try other bootable usbs same procedure
i am just stuck with the usbs boot loading screen
for hours
nothing loads
so since the hard drive is not communicating with the hp notebook
i gathered that its a hp bios communication error
perhaps an old bios version
but on the lenovo it registers but doesn't load fully
so this makes me believe that it is not the connector that is having 
communication issues it must be the hard drive itself????
